    <h3>Add A Dash Of Whimsy With A Wedding Photo Booth</h3>
    <p>Where wedding bells ring, photos are snapped and cheers are made just so happens to be the same place and time your family and friends will revisit time and again when they talk about your wedding. Your wedding is a time for celebration, a time for joy and a time for uniting two families. Your reception is typically where new friends meet old over food and drink. It is during this time that some of the greatest photos you and your spouse will own are taken. Hiring a photographer is almost a given for a wedding, but having a wedding photo booth is a relatively new idea that allows for a different nature of memories to be taken all together.</p>
    
    <h3>Which Photo Booth Is Right For Your Wedding?</h3>   
    <p>Our selection of wedding photo booth rentals is increasing almost daily because photo booths for weddings are in such high demand. While professional wedding photos, both candid and posed, are wonderful for photo albums and frames, a wedding photo booth allows for your guests to cut loose and make some memories of their own. All our photo booth rentals and kiosks offer printed photos for your guests to have in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Prints Are A Great Way To Share The Fun</h3>
    <p>These “retro style” photos are great for sharing at the reception, on social media and at home for years to come. We’ve also seen our photo booths be a huge hit with younger children. Children can be shy around a photographer but not around our photo booths. Kids love to crowd into frame and make goofy faces—a great way for kids to hang out with their cousins and new friends!</p>
