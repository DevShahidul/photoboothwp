    <h3>The Answer To A Boring Corporate Event Or Party</h3>
    <p>What’s a corporate event without a photo booth? A forgotten one, that’s what! It only took a few boring fundraising and corporate events with amateur photographers and cheap gifts bags and baskets for us to realize what the events needed. Photos are great for the business and great for those who take the time to go online to download them, but do very little for the guests during the party or event itself.</p>
    <p>Photo booth rentals are the cost effective way to make your party more interesting, memorable and affordable. Whether you’re in New York, Manhattan NY, Long Island, Westchester or New Jersey, it’s easy to rent photo booths and have them at your next event at a price you and your business can afford.</p>
    <h3>Get Your Guests Out Of Their Seats and Mingling</h3>
    <p>It’s easy to get bored at a corporate event. The attraction shouldn’t be the food or the open bar, even though sometimes they are. The point of a corporate event is, hopefully, for team members and employees from other divisions and branches to network. If the mood isn’t right at an event, networking outside of your assigned seating can seem impossible. Having activities such as a silent auction, fun games and photo booth rentals help to get your guests out of their chairs for something other than food or a refill.</p>
