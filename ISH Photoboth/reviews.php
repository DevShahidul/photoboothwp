        <p>"Thank you for making our wedding so much fun with the photo booth. We look at the book ALL the time. Just got a chance to look through the DVD of all the photos and wow are they hilarious! Everyone loved the booth and I will certainly be recommending you to others."</p>

        <p>"I am so happy to have rented the photo booth for our big day! My husband and I decided to have our wedding in Manhattan and had friends and family flying in from all over! We were able to have our guests (some of which we didn't have too much time to see during the night) leave us videos and photos. The quality of the photos and videos is fantastic (and dare I say rivaled the photographer we hired) The VideoGuest Book beautifully captured the night's events and each of our guests walked away with a photo from the night (wedding favors- check!). I highly recommend contacting them for your big day www.ishvideoguestbookcom"</p>

        <p>"In my experience, planning a wedding can be a hectic time to say the least. I wanted to make a unique statement that set my wedding reception apart from others taking place in the coming months. I booked a Photo Booth Rental from Ish Events and could not have been happier doing so! They were accommodating and provided exceptional service. Our guests had so much fun taking lots of pictures leaving one copy behind for our album and the other was taken home as a wedding favor. Each strip of photos had a customized logo we designed for our day! I was so impressed and would recommend the Photo Booth Rental though Ish Events for anyone wanting to work with a company who provides an outstanding service!"</p>

        <p>"I was at a recent birthday party and had a chance to use the Photo Booth Rental. My friends and I had such a good time taking photos and leaving the birthday girl video messages! I was able to email myself the photos right from the booth and tag and upload to facebook! I've already booked the booth for my birthday in 4 months!"</p>

        <p>"I could not be happier with the over all service of the Video Guestbook! I booked it for my wedding this past Spring. All the months of wedding planning and the day went by so fast, it is great to be able to look back and see everyone's candid videos. This created such a great keepsake!!! I was able to share a link with my friends who were unable to make it and share the celebration with them too. The videos were of beautiful quality and the guest photos were great (we had the option of a scrapbook. A definite must on any bride's to do list!)"</p>

        <p>"I am beyond happy that I booked Photo Booth Rental for my wedding last month! Courteous and efficient customer service, great price and most of all my friends and family had a blast! I even got to cross the wedding favors off my checklist because everyone had fun taking photos and got to walk away with a memory of the night. ! A must for your next event!"</p>

        <p>"I rented the ISH events photo booth for my October 1st wedding. Let me just say this. Ismael was probably the easiest vendor I worked with. He literally answered any email I sent him in no later than 20 minutes... He wanted to make sure we were truely taken care of and happy with his services and that is what a true business man is all about. Everyone had a BLAST with the photo booth and our scrapbook is absolutely hilarious and also very special. It will be a memory piece forever. We also have a DVD of all the photos taken during the night which is also very fun to look at. We had envelopes made as our favors that were crafted by Ismael and his company. Each person got a photo frame envelope to put their photos in and remember our wedding night. You cannot go wrong with ISH Events photo booth for any event especially your wedding. They were a pleasure to work with. Thank you Ismael!"</p>
