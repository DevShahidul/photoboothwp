    <h3>Have You Thought About a Party Photo Booth for Your New York Event?</h3>
    <p>It's always good when you can offer your guests something different and engaging; even better if you can provide them with a permanent memento of your event. To achieve both these aims, a growing number of party planners are recognizing the value which hiring a party photo booth can bring. Not only is a photo booth a great opportunity to obtain fantastic pictures, the prints can serve as a permanent reminder of a fun packed party or other occasion.</p>
    
    <h3>Fantastic Marketing Opportunity</h3>
    <p>If your party is a corporate one, or even if you just want to share a unique greeting with your guests, we have the ideal solution.

    <h3>Throw A Party No New Yorker Will Forget</h3>
    <p>Most people who visit New York would agree that the obvious tourist destinations are memorable and are on the “to-do” list, but one thing they didn’t prepare for were the people. The people and the crowds are what help New York to feel so alive, which is why most visitors bring a camera. Not just for the buildings and the scenery, but for all the unusual fashions, performances and culture.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But if you live in New York, the crowds and unique personalities are nothing new, so how do you make your next event feel special for New Yorkers and out-of-towners alike? If you’re hosting a party, corporate meeting or fundraiser where you’re expecting out-of-towners, you may want to think about supplying the cameras. And no we don’t mean the disposable ones from the nineties. A great way for your guests to remember your fundraiser or event is through a photo booth rental.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Our selection of photo booths and kiosks is one of the largest in New York</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul class="content-list">

    <p>Whether it’s 2 or 12 guests trying to take a photo, it’s always more fun when they do it together. Often times a professional photographer can feel impersonal or make guests feel alienated or embarrassed. Having a destination—a photo booth—for your guests to make a trip to during the event is a fun distraction and excuse for groups to combine or separate. While waiting to take the photos your group are able to mingle and muse about the night’s events.</p>
    <h3>Share Photos With Friends At The Party And Online</h3>
    <p>The instant satisfaction of prints is not only perfect for sharing on social media and friends at the party; it’s also fun and retro. Who doesn’t love an old black and white strip of photos to stick on the side of their bathroom mirror? If you’re looking to give your next event a little boost of goofy, lighthearted fun, you’ve come to the right place!</p>
